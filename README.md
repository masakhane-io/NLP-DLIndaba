# NLP-DLIndaba

This repository contains the notebooks for the Hands-On practical session with [Idris Abdulmumin](https://github.com/abumafrim) at the MasaKhane NLP workshop during the Deep Learning Indaba. The notebooks are based on HuggingFace implementation (License: Apache 2.0) for fine-tuning pre-trained language models.

The notebooks were adapted for the NLP workshop from the [MAFAND-MT](https://github.com/masakhane-io/lafand-mt) and [MasaKhaNER](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-ner) projects.
